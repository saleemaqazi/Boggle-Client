# BoggleClient

BoggleClient is a C# application that allows users to play the game of Boggle against other users through an online server. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for registering a nickname, joining games, submitting words, and displaying game results. The Boggle Client works in conjuction with the Boggle Server from my Github page. This program was written by Professor Joeseph Zachary and students Saleema Qazi and Spencer Fajardo.
