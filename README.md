# Boggle Client

This repository contains the client-side implementation of a Boggle game application, developed as part of a university project. The Boggle client allows users to play Boggle with other players online through a graphical user interface (GUI).

## Features

- User registration: Users can register their nickname to participate in the game.
- Game requests: Users can request to join a game and specify the time limit for each round.
- Boggle board display: The GUI displays the Boggle board, which is dynamically updated during the game.
- Word submission: Users can submit words they find on the Boggle board for scoring.
- Game status updates: The GUI periodically refreshes to show the current score, remaining time, and game state.
- Game completion screen: At the end of each game, a screen is displayed showing the final scores and the words played by each player.

## Technologies Used

- C#: The client application is developed using C# programming language.
- .NET Framework: The .NET Framework is used to build the client application.
- Windows Forms: The graphical user interface is implemented using Windows Forms.

## Getting Started

To run the Boggle client on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/boggle-client.git`
2. Open the project in your preferred C# development environment (e.g., Visual Studio).
3. Build the solution to resolve any dependencies.
4. Run the application.

Note: The Boggle client requires the Boggle server to be running for online multiplayer functionality.

## Usage

Upon launching the Boggle client, the GUI will be displayed, providing options for user registration and game participation. Follow the on-screen instructions to register a nickname, request a game, submit words, and interact with the game board. The GUI will automatically update with game status information.
